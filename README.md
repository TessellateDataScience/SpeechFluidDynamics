# Speech-driven aerosol distribution of common natural languages
Our motivation is primarily validation of a complementary investigation using [Computational Fluid Dynamics to design more effective Personal Protective Equipment](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations). We are particularly interested in the speech-driven 'jet' that arises, with focus on the spatial distribution of particles within the jet at ~ 1 metre downstream of the jet source. 

We are focussing on the distribution when speaking common words & phrases in the English language, include the following aspects after consideration of linguistic data [2,3]:  
	- 500 most common words,  
	- Phrases/sentences containing predominantly these words,  
	- Varying speech loudness.  

Similar to another research group [1] we employ an e-cigarette method where the vapour-based 'cloud' produced allows visualisation of these aerosols' (particle) dynamics produced from the mouth. The liquid vapourised is commonly used in the theatre sector (called 'fog machine liquid'), predominatly a mixture of water, propylene glycol, & glycerol [4].
