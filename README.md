# Speech-driven aerosol distribution of common natural languages
Within this investigation we attempt to generalise the trajectories of aerosols out of a person's mouth when speaking. Similar to another research group [1] we employ an e-cigarette method where the vapour-based 'cloud' produced allows visualisation of these aerosols' (particle) dynamics produced from the mouth.

Our motivation is primarily validation of a complementary investigation employing Computational Fluid Dynamics. We are particularly interested in the speech-driven 'jet' that arises, with focus on the spatial distribution of particles within the jet at ~ 1 metre downstream of the jet source.

We are focussing on the distribution when speaking common words & phrases in the English language. Although we're also interested in other common languages such as Chinese, Indian, Spanish, we suspect native speakers would better represent the particle dynamics of those countries' citizens, generally. 

For our English investigation, we include the following aspects after consideration of linguistic data [2,3]:  
	- 500 most common words,  
	- Phrases/sentences containing predominantly these words,  
	- Varying speech loudness.  

Once an adequate picture of the dynamics is constructed, attention then can shift to applying this insight towards designing more effective Personal Protective Equipment (see our [CFD research](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations)).
