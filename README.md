# Fluid-dynamic characteristics of speech-driven flows of the most-common natural languages
This research will aim to qualify and ultimately gain a grasp of the fluid dynamic, in particular turbulence, characteristics of aiflow out of a person's mouth while speaking. The most popular languages will be considered, including: English, Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish. 

Focus will be on the time-dependent turbulent properties [1] of the different language-based flows, with particular interest in the fluid dynamics of the most common words spoken within each selected langague. Once an adequate picture of the dynamics is constructed, attention then can shift to applying this insight towards designing more effective Personal Protective Equipment (see our [other propsed research](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations)).
