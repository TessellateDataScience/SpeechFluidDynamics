# Fluid dynamic characteristic of speech-driven flows of the most common natural languages
This research will aim to qualify and ultimately quantify the fluid dynamic, in particular turbulence, characteristics of aiflow out of a person's mouth while speaking. Statistical models of the most common words spoken will be assumed as components of the sentences. Numerous languages will be considered (focussing on languages with the most number of speakers) including: English, Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish. Focus will be on the time-dependent turbulent properties [1] of the different language-based flows.
